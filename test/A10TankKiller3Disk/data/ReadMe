                     A10 Tank Killer Enhanced for the Amiga
                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here are some tips for running Amiga A10E.


- Make copies of your original game disks NOW!  A10E is not copy protected
  so you may backup your disks or install the game on a hard disk.

- NEVER remove a disk while the drive light is on. In fact, never swap disks
  unless instructed to do so by the program.

- For best performance, leave A10E Disk #1 in any drive when playing this
  game from floppy disks.

- A10E supports 16-, 32-, and 64-color graphics modes, some with dithering
  and light-source shading.  Try low graphics settings at first, increasing 
  gradually until you're comfortable with the mix of speed and detail.  Most
  Amigas will perform best in modes 1-5; accelerated machines will do well
  in all eight.

- Adjusting the world detail down will improve the speed of the game, as
  will turning off sound effects.

- If you have a hard disk but no extra memory (1MB only), music and sound
  effects may be deactivated.  You may boot directly from copies of your
  original game disks, or modify your Startup-Sequence to remove background
  programs which may eat memory.

- If you have LOTS of free RAM, you may copy all files from the A10E disks
  to RAM: (the RAM disk) and run the game from there.

- If your computer has no fast memory (as is the case with most newer Amiga
  500s and 2000s) A10E will take longer to perform certain tasks. So...
  if you see the message "Please Wait," then please do.

- It's always a good idea to disable all screenblanker utilities before
  running any commercial game.
